# Contributing to SkinScan AI

We love your input! We want to make contributing to SkinScan AI as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to sync code, track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/yourusername/skin-cancer-classification/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/skin-cancer-classification/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Create a branch for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
   ```

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Comment your code where necessary
- Write docstrings for functions and classes

## Testing

- Add tests for any new functionality
- Ensure all existing tests pass
- Test the Streamlit app manually before submitting

## Medical and Ethical Considerations

Given the medical nature of this project:

- Always include appropriate medical disclaimers
- Ensure any changes maintain the "informational purposes only" stance
- Do not make claims about diagnostic accuracy without proper validation
- Respect privacy and data protection principles

## Commit Messages

- Use clear and descriptive commit messages
- Start with a capital letter
- Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

## Documentation

- Update documentation for any new features
- Include examples where appropriate
- Update README.md if needed

## Questions?

Don't hesitate to ask questions by opening an issue or contacting the maintainers directly.
